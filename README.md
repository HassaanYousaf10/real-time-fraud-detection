Real-Time Fraud Detection
Built on top of Apache Spark and Kafka for big data streaming solutions.

Real-Time Fraud Detection is a framework aimed at ingesting transaction data in real time, filtering out fraudulent transactions via Spark Structured Streaming, and orchestrating everything with Docker + Kubernetes (Helm). This design can be adapted to Ilum because Ilum also uses Helm-based orchestration under the hood.

How does it work?
Data Producer
A Python script that continuously generates synthetic transactions. Each transaction has fields like card_number, amount, timestamp, and is_fraud.

Publishes to a Kafka topic (e.g., fraud_transactions).

Spark Structured Streaming
A job that subscribes to the Kafka topic and applies a simple (or advanced) filter:

python
Copy
Edit
fraud_df = df.filter(col("is_fraud") == 1)
Logs or outputs flagged transactions in real time.

Helm + Kubernetes

The Spark job container is defined in a Helm chart, deploying on a K8s cluster.

Helm separates environment configs (like Kafka addresses) so the pipeline can be moved or reconfigured easily.

What is the main idea behind Real-Time Fraud Detection?
Data engineers want a fast feedback loop on suspicious activity:

Ingest transactions from various sources in real time,

Filter or score them based on rules/ML,

Immediate detection logs or alerts for further investigation.

Separation of concerns:

Transaction producer focuses on generating or streaming raw data,

Spark job does core detection/alerting,

Kubernetes handles scaling and resilience,

Ilum (optional) can handle advanced scheduling and job management because it’s Helm-based.

Quick Start
1. Bring up Kafka (optional local Docker Compose)
bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up -d
(Broker at localhost:9092.)

2. Build & Push Docker Image
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t youruser/fraud-detection-spark:latest .
docker push youruser/fraud-detection-spark:latest
3. Deploy via Helm
bash
Copy
Edit
cd fraud-detection-chart
helm package .
cd ..
helm upgrade --install fraud-detection ./fraud-detection-0.1.0.tgz
4. Start Transaction Producer
bash
Copy
Edit
cd data_generator
python transaction_producer.py
Continuously sends random transactions to fraud_transactions.

5. Check Spark Logs
bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs <spark-driver-pod>
Look for entries logging is_fraud == 1.

Usage
Data Flow
Producer → sends JSON transaction data with a field is_fraud.

Kafka → buffers & streams to Spark.

Spark → fraud_detection_streaming.py reads from Kafka, filters for fraudulent records, logs them to console.

Sample config snippet (Helm values.yaml)
yaml
Copy
Edit
sparkJob:
  image: "youruser/fraud-detection-spark:latest"
  kafkaBootstrap: "kafka-service:9092"
  replicas: 2
(Then used in templates/deployment.yaml to configure job environment.)

Ilum Orchestrate Compatibility
Helm chart usage is the same approach Ilum uses for containerized big data pipelines.

By packaging your pipeline in Docker + Helm, you can drop it into Ilum for advanced scheduling, job management, and cluster-level orchestration.

Contribution
Where to contribute:

Enhanced Fraud Logic: e.g., Spark ML classification

New Streams: additional inputs (transactions from other systems)

Dashboards: real-time metrics with Grafana/Prometheus

CI/CD: automated Docker builds & Helm releases

Steps:

Fork/clone the repo,

Make improvements,

Submit a PR to main branch.

Example of Java code for advanced logic
(If you integrate custom Java-based logic via Spark, e.g., using a Job interface, similar to how the sample readme showed .)

java
Copy
Edit
public class FraudScoring {
    public static Dataset<Row> detect(Dataset<Row> input) {
        // advanced ML or rule-based logic
        return input.filter("score > 0.8");
    }
}
Final Notes
This approach (producer + streaming job + K8s + Helm) demonstrates a real-time pipeline suitable for Ilum or pure open-source.

Expand with data sinks (databases, dashboards) or upgrade the filter logic to machine learning.
